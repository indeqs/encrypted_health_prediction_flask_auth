            <h2>3. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</h2>
            <p>Our platform utilizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption, an advanced encryption technology that allows us to
                perform computations on encrypted data without having access to the underlying plaintext information.
            </p>
            <p>When you submit health data to our Service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your data is encrypted on your device before transmission</li>
                <li>The data remains encrypted while stored on our servers</li>
                <li>All processing and analysis occur while your data remains encrypted</li>
                <li>Only you possess the decryption key necessary to access your unencrypted health information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that even we, as the service provider, cannot see or access your actual health data.</p>
